Numerical Differentiation
=========================

What is it?
-----------
Numerical differentiation as its name implies is estimating the derivative of a function.

Why is it useful?
-----------------
Think back to calculus when you first learned derivatives. Derivatives that can be done by hand and thus had closed form solutions account for a very small portion of all possible derivatives. For the remaining messy derivatives we use numerical differentiation methods to obtain an accurate approximation.
