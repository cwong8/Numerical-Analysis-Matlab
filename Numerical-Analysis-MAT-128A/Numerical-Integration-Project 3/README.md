Numerical Integration
=====================

What is it?
-----------
Numerical integration as its name implies is estimating the integral of a function.

Why is it useful?
--------------------
Think back to calculus when you first learned integration. Integrals that can be done by hand and thus had closed form solutions account for a very small portion of all possible integrals. For the remaining messy integrals we use numerical integration methods to obtain an accurate approximation.
