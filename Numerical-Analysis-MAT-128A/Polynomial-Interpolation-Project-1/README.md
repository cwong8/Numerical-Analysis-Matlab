Polynomial Interpolation
========================

What is it?
-----------
Polynomial interpolation, as its name suggests, is interpolating a polynomial to a set of given data points. In layman's terms, it fits a polynomial (or curve) that passes through the given points.

Why is it useful?
-----------------
A set of points alone does not tell us much information or anything about how these points are related. However, if we could somehow fit a curve to these points we could obtain a reasonable approximation of the function that they come from. This in turns allows us to visualize and find a relationship between the data points.
