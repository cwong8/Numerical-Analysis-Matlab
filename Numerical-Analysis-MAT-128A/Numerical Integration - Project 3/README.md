Numerical Integration
=====================

What is it?
-----------
Numerical integration as its name implies is estimating the integral of a function.

Why is it useful?
--------------------
Think back to calculus when you first learned integration. Remember when it became a lot more complicated when you moved past integrating polynomials? It became a lot more complicated. In fact, the integrals you probably did all had closed form (i.e. can be written "nicely") solutions. But what if I told you that closed form integrals are a very small portion of all possible integrals in the world? How do we integrate a function that cannot be integrated nicely? Well, by numerical integration methods of course!
